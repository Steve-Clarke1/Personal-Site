### PhD Thesis
**Title:** *Railway Track Asset Management Modelling* <br>
Developed a WLC model to represent a railway track using a stochastic Petri-Net approach, including geometry degradation, rail faults, inspections, maintenance, upgrades and renewals. The model could predict long term future costs of managing a railway track and allowed different management regimes to be benchmarked to help inform decisions. As part of the model development a statistical analysis of real world data was performed to identify the major factors that affect the rate of degradation, occurrence of faults and maintenance effectiveness.
